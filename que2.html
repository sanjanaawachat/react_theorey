2] what is pure components?
ans:

1] Pure components or Container Components are simply components based on React Component, they are classes, and they hold states. In other words, Pure components are the default form react and react native components comes as. They Do have state, and you can use and manipulate it using this.state and this.setState ().

2]Now, ReactJS has provided us a Pure Component. If we extend a class with Pure Component, there is no need for shouldComponentUpdate() Lifecycle Method. ReactJS Pure Component Class compares current state and props with new props and states to decide whether the React component should re-render itself or  Not.

3]In simple words, If the previous value of state or props and the new value of state or props is the same, the component will not re-render itself. Since Pure Components restricts the re-rendering when there is no use of re-rendering of the component. Pure Components are Class Components which extends React.PureComponent.
